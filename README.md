**ToxPred** is a Machine Learning application designed to accelerate early-stage drug discovery. It predicts critical physicochemical and biological properties of small molecules before synthesis, helping chemists "fail early" and prioritize viable drug candidates.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **💧 Solubility Prediction (LogS):** Regressor trained on the **Delaney (ESOL)** dataset to predict aqueous solubility.
* **☠️ Toxicity Screening:** Classifier trained on the **ClinTox** dataset to flag compounds that failed clinical trials.
* **🧠 Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Permeability:** Classifier trained on **BBBP** data to predict CNS penetration (crucial for Neuro-drug discovery).
* **💊 Drug-Likeness:** Automatic calculation of **Lipinski’s Rule of Five** to assess oral bioavailability.
* **🧬 Structural Intelligence:** Uses **Morgan Fingerprints (ECFP4)** to analyze chemical substructures (2,048-bit vectors) rather than simple molecular weights.

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | Dataset | Algorithm | Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Solubility** | Delaney (ESOL) | Random Forest Regressor | R² ≈ 0.87 |
| **Toxicity** | ClinTox (FDA) | Random Forest Classifier | Acc ≈ 76% |
| **BBB Permeability** | BBBP | Random Forest Classifier | ROC-AUC ≈ 0.85 |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Cheminformatics:** RDKit (Molecular Descriptor Calculation & Fingerprinting)
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Ensemble)
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit
* **Data Source:** DeepChem & PubChem PUG REST API

## Featured projects

### 1) Explainable AI for Biomarker Prioritization (LC–MS Metabolomics)
**Objective:** Build an interpretable ML pipeline to prioritize candidate biomarkers from high-dimensional assay data.

**Highlights**
- Preprocessed and analyzed a cachexia metabolomics dataset; performed QC with PCA and volcano-style inspection.
- Benchmarked sparse linear models (feature selection) vs tree-based models (non-linearity).
- Used **SHAP** to interpret drivers and communicate which features matter and why.
- Emphasis on **reproducibility** and **stakeholder-friendly interpretation** (what to validate next and how to reduce scope).

**Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP, Seaborn  
**Project:** `./metabolomics-biomarker-discovery/`

### 2) Gas Sensor Drift & Calibration Transfer (Concept Drift)
**Objective:** Quantify long-term drift and evaluate strategies to keep sensor models stable over time.

**Highlights**
- Analyzed a longitudinal sensor dataset and visualized drift behavior with PCA and performance decay curves.
- Measured how static models degrade as sensors age (concept drift).
- Implemented adaptive calibration / windowed retraining strategies to maintain performance under drift.
- Clear takeaway: how to design a practical monitoring + retraining policy for long-lived sensor deployments.
