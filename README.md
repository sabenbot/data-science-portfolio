## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am an Analytical Chemist (PhD) transitioning to Data Science after 10+ years managing diagnostic systems and experimental research. I combine deep domain expertise in **instrumentation and signal processing** with modern machine learning to solve real-world problems in predictive maintenance, pharma, and industrial analytics.

My background is not just "analyzing numbers"—it is about verifying the physical reality behind the data. I bring a rigorous **validation mindset** (checking for drift, noise, and reproducibility) that is often missing in standard data science workflows.

## 💡 What Makes This Portfolio Different

Unlike typical bootcamp portfolios, every analysis here is treated like a scientific experiment:
- ✅ **Solves "Messy" Physical Problems:** Sensor drift, biological variability, and signal noise.
- ✅ **Focuses on Validation:** Using rigorous cross-validation and stability checks, not just "Accuracy scores."
- ✅ **Emphasizes Explainability:** Using SHAP and feature importance to tell the "Why," not just the "What."
- ✅ **Bridges Disciplines:** Translating concepts from **Instrument Calibration** directly to **Machine Learning**.

I am not learning data science from scratch—I am adding ML to a decade of analytical thinking.

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 1. [LC-MS Metabolomics Biomarker Discovery](./metabolomics-biomarker-discovery/)
**Objective:** Identify biological markers for muscle wasting (Cachexia) using ML on high-dimensional chemical data.

**Highlights:**
- Analyzed real human cachexia dataset (76 samples, 63 metabolites) with high biological variability.
- Performed chemometric QC using **Volcano Plots** and **PCA** to validate sample separation.
- Compared **Lasso Regression** (for feature selection) vs. **Random Forest** (for non-linearity).
- Identified key metabolic drivers (e.g., Glucose, 3-Hydroxybutyrate) using **SHAP values**.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, SHAP, Seaborn (Volcano Plots)
**Business Impact:** Accelerates biomarker discovery pipelines by prioritizing high-confidence candidates for clinical validation.

### 2. [Gas Sensor Drift & Calibration Transfer](./gas-sensor-drift-monitoring/)
**Objective:** Solve "Concept Drift" in industrial chemical sensors to extend hardware lifespan.

**Highlights:**
- Analyzed a 3-year longitudinal dataset (13,910 measurements) from 16 chemical sensors.
- Visualized **Concept Drift** using PCA, showing how sensor aging degrades model performance.
- Quantified the "Cost of Inaction": Static models lost **66.9% accuracy** over 36 months.
- Implemented an **Adaptive Calibration** strategy (active retraining) that recovered accuracy to **>90%**.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn (PCA, Random Forest), Drift Detection
**Business Impact:** Reduces calibration costs and extends the operational life of remote IIoT sensor networks.

### 3. [NASA Turbofan Predictive Maintenance](./nasa-turbofan-predictive-maintenance/)
**Objective:** Predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using sensor time-series.

**Highlights:**
- Processed multivariate time-series data from 100 turbofan engines (NASA C-MAPSS).
- Engineered **Rolling Statistics** and **Trend Features** to distinguish true degradation from signal noise.
- Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict failure cycles (RMSE: ~20 cycles).
- Validated the model using a "Leave-One-Group-Out" strategy to prevent data leakage.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Time-Series Analysis, Random Forest, Matplotlib
**Business Impact:** Enables predictive maintenance scheduling, reducing unplanned downtime and optimizing parts inventory.
