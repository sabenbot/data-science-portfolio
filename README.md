## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am an Analytical Chemist (PhD, USP-Brazil) applying my research expertise to **data science and machine learning** in industry. My background includes 6 years as **Professor at Universidade Federal de Uberlândia** (2015-2021) and 2+ years as **Research Group Leader at Hahn-Schickard Institute, Germany** (2022-2024), where I developed analytical methods and led R&D projects.

Now, I'm focused on **applied data science**—using my domain knowledge in instrumentation, chemistry, and experimental design to build better ML models for real-world problems in pharma, diagnostics, and Industry 4.0 applications. My research background (50 publications, 1,266 citations, h-index 18) gives me a unique advantage: I understand the **physical systems behind the data**, enabling me to build more robust and interpretable models for predictive maintenance, sensor analytics, and smart manufacturing.

## 💡 What Makes This Portfolio Different

This portfolio showcases **data science with deep domain knowledge**. My analytical chemistry background gives me an advantage that typical data scientists lack:

- **I understand the physical systems generating the data** (sensors, instruments, chemical processes)
- **I know when models are wrong** (from years of validating analytical methods and troubleshooting instruments)
- **I think in experiments** (hypothesis testing, controls, validation—not just train/test splits)
- **I can bridge technical teams** (from lab scientists to data engineers)

Every project here demonstrates how domain expertise makes data science better:
- ✅ **Physics-Informed Features:** Engineering features based on how sensors actually behave
- ✅ **Rigorous Validation:** Applying laboratory QA/QC thinking to ML model validation
- ✅ **Explainable Models:** Using SHAP and chemometric techniques to build trust with domain experts
- ✅ **Real-World Robustness:** Accounting for drift, noise, and measurement uncertainty

I'm not just doing data science—I'm doing **better data science** because I understand what the data means.
