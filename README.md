## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am an Analytical Chemist (PhD, USP-Brazil) with a research career spanning academic leadership and applied industrial R&D. After 6 years as **Professor Adjunto at Universidade Federal de Uberlândia** (2015-2021) and 2+ years as **Research Group Leader at Hahn-Schickard Institute, Germany** (2022-2024), I now apply my expertise in **analytical instrumentation and data science** to solve complex problems in pharma, diagnostics, and industrial analytics.

My research background includes **50 peer-reviewed publications** (1,266 citations, h-index 18) in analytical chemistry, with expertise in molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), biosensors, and green analytical methods. I bring a **validation-first mindset** from a decade of managing analytical laboratories, where verifying data quality and understanding measurement uncertainty are fundamental—principles often missing in standard data science workflows.

## 💡 What Makes This Portfolio Different

This portfolio bridges **analytical chemistry rigor** with **modern data science**. With a background that includes:
- 6 years as university professor teaching analytical chemistry
- 50+ peer-reviewed publications in analytical method development
- Leadership of EU-funded research projects in Germany
- Expertise in designing and validating analytical instruments

Every analysis here applies the same experimental rigor I used in laboratory research:
- ✅ **Physics-Informed Modeling:** Understanding sensor behavior, drift, and measurement uncertainty.
- ✅ **Validation-First Approach:** Cross-validation, stability testing, and statistical rigor—not just accuracy scores.
- ✅ **Explainability:** Using SHAP and chemometric techniques to understand "why," not just "what."
- ✅ **Domain Translation:** Applying concepts from instrument calibration and method validation to ML pipelines.

This is not a bootcamp portfolio—it's analytical chemistry expertise applied to data science problems.

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 1. [LC-MS Metabolomics Biomarker Discovery](./metabolomics-biomarker-discovery/)
**Objective:** Identify biological markers for muscle wasting (Cachexia) using ML on high-dimensional chemical data.

**Highlights:**
- Analyzed real human cachexia dataset (76 samples, 63 metabolites) with high biological variability.
- Performed chemometric QC using **Volcano Plots** and **PCA** to validate sample separation.
- Compared **Lasso Regression** (for feature selection) vs. **Random Forest** (for non-linearity).
- Identified key metabolic drivers (e.g., Glucose, 3-Hydroxybutyrate) using **SHAP values**.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, SHAP, Seaborn (Volcano Plots)
**Business Impact:** Accelerates biomarker discovery pipelines by prioritizing high-confidence candidates for clinical validation.

### 2. [Gas Sensor Drift & Calibration Transfer](./gas-sensor-drift-monitoring/)
**Objective:** Solve "Concept Drift" in industrial chemical sensors to extend hardware lifespan.

**Highlights:**
- Analyzed a 3-year longitudinal dataset (13,910 measurements) from 16 chemical sensors.
- Visualized **Concept Drift** using PCA, showing how sensor aging degrades model performance.
- Quantified the "Cost of Inaction": Static models lost **66.9% accuracy** over 36 months.
- Implemented an **Adaptive Calibration** strategy (active retraining) that recovered accuracy to **>90%**.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn (PCA, Random Forest), Drift Detection
**Business Impact:** Reduces calibration costs and extends the operational life of remote IIoT sensor networks.

### 3. [NASA Turbofan Predictive Maintenance](./nasa-turbofan-predictive-maintenance/)
**Objective:** Predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using sensor time-series.

**Highlights:**
- Processed multivariate time-series data from 100 turbofan engines (NASA C-MAPSS).
- Engineered **Rolling Statistics** and **Trend Features** to distinguish true degradation from signal noise.
- Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict failure cycles (RMSE: ~20 cycles).
- Validated the model using a "Leave-One-Group-Out" strategy to prevent data leakage.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Time-Series Analysis, Random Forest, Matplotlib
**Business Impact:** Enables predictive maintenance scheduling, reducing unplanned downtime and optimizing parts inventory.
