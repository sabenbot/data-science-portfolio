- **GDPR:** Data privacy and security considerations for patient data

**Clinical Safety:**
- **Clarke Error Grid:** Gold standard for glucose prediction validation
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Risk-aware predictions with confidence intervals
- **Explainability:** SHAP provides transparent, auditable feature contributions

**Traceability & Reproducibility:**
- Chronological data splits prevent look-ahead bias
- Random seeds ensure reproducible model training
- Environment versioning captured in notebooks
- Model artifacts saved with version identifiers

**Limitations & Next Steps:**
- Current results based on synthetic data (realistic but simplified)
- Real-world validation needed with FDA-approved CGM devices (Dexcom, Abbott FreeStyle Libre)
- Patient-specific calibration and personalization
- Prospective clinical trials for regulatory submission
- Edge case handling (sensor failures, rapid glucose changes)

**Chemistry/Analytical Science Perspective:**
- CGM sensors use glucose oxidase electrochemistry
- Signal processing accounts for sensor drift and lag time
- Feature engineering informed by glucose metabolism kinetics
- Analytical validation (precision, accuracy, LOD) required for clinical deployment
